&I led part of the engineering team for Audience Republic's SaaS CRM and marketing platform for event organizers. The Vue.js frontend and Clojure backend (Postgres, RabbitMQ, Redis) powered integrations, messaging, events, and more.\\ \\

&I was responsible for the development, maintenance and ongoing operation of integrations with 20+ third-party platforms, enabling seamless data import/export. Additionally, I designed a high-performance Clojure ingestion API and optimized the email service (2M+ recipients) for faster delivery.\\ \\

&Leading a small team, I managed sprints, user stories, and code reviews, while mentoring engineers and building the future of Audience Republic.\\ \\

2018--2022 &{\bf Queensland Department of Education} \textperiodcentered{} \textit{Analyst Programmer}\\ \\

&I developed and deployed a number of web applications for managing employee data within a large HR department handling 85,000 employees. These single-page applications leveraged Angular and .NET to interact with both Oracle and SQL Server databases.\\ \\

&I built the front-end using modern tools like Angular with Typescript and ngrx/store for state management. On the backend, I developed {\Csharp} ASP.NET MVC APIs, utilizing the latest features of the language and the department's own Cloud.NET framework. This project provided me with hands-on experience with both Angular and ASP.NET MVC, along with in-depth knowledge of interacting with Oracle and SQL Server databases.\\ \\

&I led a small team of programmers in developing the Kuube 3D Simulation Training platform used by major international companies for training employees in Workplace Health and Safety and Biosecurity Inspection. I developed the 3D Unity application for PC, iOS and WebGL and was the primary full-stack developer for the learning management web app deployed to Amazon Web Services.\\ \\

&I was the sole developer responsible for implementing a 3D Virtual Refractor for the Brien Holden Vision Institute used to augment the training of optometry students both in Australia and internationally. I built both the Unity simulation and the Clojure-based supporting learning management web application.\\ \\

&I was responsible for architecting and maintaining build systems, development and deployment tools, and the cloud-based infrastructure backing for Bondi Labs' web applications, websites and other company services.\\ \\ 

2011--2014 &{\bf Flight Centre Software Services} \textperiodcentered{} \textit{Senior Developer}\\ \\
&I enhanced and supported a suite of corporate travel booking applications built in a mixture of enterprise Java technologies, which service over 2,500 companies throughout Australasia.\\ \\ 

&I enhanced security and stability of legacy Java web applications with custom Python scripts to discover SQL injection and cross site scripting vulnerabilities.\\ \\

&I created a Spring/Hibernate Java web application for corporate chartered travel booking, and worked end to end on the application from schema design to jQuery/JSP front end.\\ \\
