\section*{Objective}

I am a generalist programmer expanding into a new field with current tertiary studies in Environmental Science and Ecology. I have a diverse development background that has equipped me to take on many technology challenges. My aim is to apply these skills to solving problems related to the natural world, an area I have always been passionate about.
